# Q4_Project1

Hey what's up. I'm Joshua West-Williams and this is my project for Quake 4.

How to Play:

* Just like regular Quake 4, except it's a little faster and weapons aren't crap.
* Both your shotgun and machine gun have lots of ammo, but your rocket launcher has no ammo at the start.
* You have a score counter and a multiplier:
   * Every enemy gives 150 score
   * 2 enemies killed = 2x score
   * 4 enemies killed = 3x score
   * 6 enemies killed = 4x score
   * If you take damage, the multiplier is reset.
   * For every 6th enemy you kill, you get **one** rocket. If you already have a rocket, you get ammo and health instead.
   * NOTE: there is an invisible kill counter keeping track of your kills, which determines your multiplier. ***When your multiplier drops, so does your kill count*** so do your best to not get hit :)


## Installation notes:

The "Misc files" folder to keep my script/def files to send over git in addition to a README telling you where to place the script files.

There is a shortcut also placed in the script files folder that can be used to launch the mod directly, however you will likely need to change the installation directory in the Quake 4, as I have the GOG version. **BE SURE TO NAME YOUR MOD FOLDER 'super'**
