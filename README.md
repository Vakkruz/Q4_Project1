# Q4_Project1

Hey what's up. This is my project for Quake 4.

How to Play:

* Just like regular Quake 4, except it's a little faster and weapons aren't crap.
* Both your shotgun and machine gun have lots of ammo, but your rocket launcher has no ammo at the start.
* You have a score counter and a multiplier:
  *Every enemy gives 150 score
  *2 enemies killed = 2x
  *4 enemies killed = 3x
  *6 enemies killed = 4x
  *If you take damage, the multiplier is reset.
  *For every 6th enemy you kill, you get a rocket.
