# Q4_Project1

Hey what's up. I'm Joshua West-Williams and this is my project for Quake 4.

How to Play:

* Just like regular Quake 4, except it's a little faster and weapons aren't crap.
* Both your shotgun and machine gun have lots of ammo, but your rocket launcher has no ammo at the start.
* You have a score counter and a multiplier:
   * Every enemy gives 150 score
   * 2 enemies killed = 2x
   * 4 enemies killed = 3x
   * 6 enemies killed = 4x
   * If you take damage, the multiplier is reset
   * For every 6th enemy you kill, you get **one** rocket. If you already have a rocket, you get ammo and health instead.
   * NOTE: there is an "invisible" kill counter keeping track of your kills, which determines your multiplier. ***When your multiplier drops, so does your kill count*** so do your best to not get hit :)
